Getting started with Git


The aim of this stage is to learn the most used version control system as well as
a server for storing versioned projects. These are git and github respectively. 

Tasks:

1. Read this tutorial and practice
https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners

2. Practical:
using the github account earlier created in task 1:
-> Create a new repository
-> Clone to local computer
-> Add files and create multiple branches: master, staging, development, drafts
-> Push all the branches to github
-> Invite me as a collaborator to the repository(my github name: Calebfonyuy)
-> Submit a text file with the various commands used at each step of the practical task.
